        <b>Al-'Ula</b>, is a city of the Medina Region in north-western Saudi
        Arabia. Historically located on the incense route, the city lies within
        the Governorate of 'Ula, one of seven in the Medina Region, covering an
        area of 29,261 square kilometres (11,298 sq mi).<br />
        The city is 110 km (68 mi) southwest of Tayma and 300 km (190 mi) north
        of Medina. The city (municipality) covers 2,391 square kilometres (923
        sq mi).<br />
        The population of the city is 5,426. Al-'Ula was the capital of the
        ancient Lihyanites (Dedanites). The governorate contains the first
        UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Saudi Kingdom, called Hegra (also
        known as Al-Hijr, or Mada'in Saleh / Mada'in Salih), 22 km (14 mi) north
        of the city. Hegra (Mada'in Salih) was built more than 2,000 years ago
        by the Nabataeans. Al-'Ula, the ancient walled city, is packed with
        mud-brick and stone houses.
