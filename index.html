        <b>Saudi Arabia</b>, officially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
        (<em>KSA</em>), is a country in Western Asia. It spans the vast majority
        of the Arabian Peninsula, with a land area of approximately 2,150,000
        km2 (830,000 sq mi). <br />
        <u>
          Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the Middle East, and the
          second-largest country in the Arab world.
        </u>
        <br />
        It is bordered by <b>Jordan and Iraq</b> to the north, <b>Kuwait</b> to
        the northeast, <b>Qatar, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates</b> to
        the east, <b>Oman</b> to the southeast and <b>Yemen</b> to the south; it
        is separated from Egypt and Palestine in the north-west by the Gulf of
        Aqaba.<br />
        Saudi Arabia is the only country with a coastline along both the Red Sea
        and the Persian Gulf, and most of its terrain consists of arid desert,
        lowland, steppe and mountains. <br />
